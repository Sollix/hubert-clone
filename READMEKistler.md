***WHAT IT DOES***
This bot does almost nothing truly *useful*, but it does some cool things:

The command "gimme pizza" gives you a gif of a cat with spinning pizzas for eyes. It was originally just triggered on "pizza," but if there's one thing I've learned from Hubot at work, one-word triggers get annoying quick and everyone hates you for using them.

If you mention hubot and follow with bandcamp #####, it will return the most recent release for the band you enter on bandcamp. This is, at this time, contingent on you knowing the band's actual url (more details in challenges).

If you mention/dm hubot and follow with "do I need to bring lunch today?" it will respond one of three ways:
	* If it is the first Monday of the month, it will tell you that you don't need to bring lunch, as it's free lunch monday at my company.
	* If it is a Monday, but not the first Monday of the month, it will tell you that you might get free lunch, as there are generally leftovers from the Monday executive meeting
	* If it is any other weekday, it will tell you you should bring lunch
	* If it's the weekend, you're told to get off slack
